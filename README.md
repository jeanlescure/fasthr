# Fast Hot Reload (fasthr)

This is a tiny CLI tool that mixes together [no-bs-typescript-server-boilerplate](https://github.com/jeanlescure/no-bs-typescript-server-boilerplate), [fastify](https://github.com/fastify/fastify), and [livereload](http://livereload.com/) to easily spin up a hot reload http server on the current directory.

Install globally:

# Start the server on the current directory on port 8080
$ fasthr -p 8080
```

Run help for more options:

```
$ fasthr -h

Usage:
  node fasthr [OPTION]

Options:
  -d, --dir          root directory where to serve files from.
  -p, --port         port to run server on.
  -l, --livePort     port to run livereload on.
  -h, --help         display this help
```

## Development

I chose Rollup to handle the transpiling, compression, and any other transformations needed to get
your Typescript code running as quickly and performant as possible.

```
yarn dev
```

Runs Rollup in watch mode which means it will hot-reload the server as you modify your source! This
includes running node with the `--inspect` flag so you can inspect your code using [Google Chrome Dev Tools](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/)
(by opening `chrome://inspect` in your browser), you're welcome ;)
